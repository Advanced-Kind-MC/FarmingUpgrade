# FarmingUpgrade
Upgraded farming mechanics.
### Compatibility
Tested for Spigot 1.15.2.
### Features
- Harvesting a grown crop with a hoe automatically replants the crop.
- Hoes do not break crops that are not fully grown.
- Hoes harvest grown crops within a range. Wood and stone have a range of 0, iron and gold a range of 1 and diamond a range of 2.
- Hoes with higher enchantment levels of Unbreaking have a lower chance to take damage when harvesting crops.
- Higher levels of Efficiency increases the range of the hoe. For every 2 levels of Efficiency, the hoe gains 1 range.
- Farmland is no longer trampled. Instead, the crop that is planted on it is reset to its first growth stage.
- Water can be placed up to 2 blocks underneath Farmland to hydrate it.
### Installation
Place the FarmingUpgrade jar file in the Bukkit server's plugins directory.
